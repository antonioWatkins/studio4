menu will have food name, price, description, type ,day, and new item;

there is a potential to create hashmaps for this.

food: price

day: newItems


there is a potential to have the app check the day. and check the day agaisnt the date
assoicated with fooditem.

if day is less than 30 days old count it as new. if not say nothing.

honestly menu and type should be the same thing. so if someoen wants to go to the dessert menu they can do that.
